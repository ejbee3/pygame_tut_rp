# Small game based on Real Python pygame tutorial

- [Source](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer)
- I made all the assets myself!
- Inspiration of art style originates from my roommate making me crush a bug outside
  and it made me think about what it would be like attempting to avoid things
  that are trying to smush you!
